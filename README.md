# Jiujustsu_machine_learning

Our group work on classifying different positions/poses in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu using: https://vicos.si/resources/jiujitsu/. This dataset contains 120,279 labeled images of 2 jiu-jitsu athletes sparring in different combat positions. We created a model that can classify images of people doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu into 10 positions that break down into 18 classes. 

We employed neural network for our classification model. We attempted to create both a recurrent NN and a convolutional NN to determine which model has a higher accuracy rate for this problem.
